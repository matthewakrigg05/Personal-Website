    <h2>My Achievements So Far</h2>
    <p>
      So far, whilst undertaking my degree, I have been expanding my knowledge
      by completing various other courses online as well as working on my own
      projects on the side, some of which you can find on this website and on
      my GitHub. In addition to this, I considered myself a valuable member of
      the computer science department's Research Club where, as a group, we
      completed various projects, some of which were published. I was also
      responsible for setting up and being president of the university's Coding
      Club Society, in which I ran the club and gave other programmers a space
      to work together outside of lectures and seminars on projects or general
      enhancing of their coding ability.

      During my time at university I was very proud to have been awarded the
      Academic Achievement award for outstanding results in my studies. This
      was very special to me as it proved to me that hard work does truly pay
      off, inspiring and further encouraging me to put in 110% at all times! I
      also undertook a volunteering role, in my second year, as a student
      mentor in the Computer Science department. If you would like to know more
      I have expanded on these two achievements further in my{" "}
