      First of all, hello, my name is Matt. I'm a Computer Science student at
      Edge Hill University as well as an aspiring software engineer. The
      purpose of this website, that I have created, is to show off my previous
      work, things that I am working on now, and talk a little bit more about
      me.
    </p>
