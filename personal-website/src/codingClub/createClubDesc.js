const ClubDescription = () => <p>In my first year of university, I took the initiative to set up a Coding Club Society as there was not one yet running. I felt as though there was not yet a good 
                        way for people who are interested in programming to gather, collaberate and discuss topics in and related to programming. In the club,
                        we work together on a range of small projects to gradually teach eachother new technologies as well as developing our ability to work as teams.
                        We also ran a number of small events where we invited non-society members to try out activities in order to show people how important digital literacy
                        is and how it can aid them in their fields that may not be directly related to technology.
