            <h1>Running The University Coding Club</h1>
            <p>In my first year of university, I decided to set up a Coding Club as there was not one already running. I felt as though there was not a good 
                existing way for people who are interested in programming to gather, collaberate and discuss topics in and related to programming. In the club,
                we worked together on a range of small projects to gradually teach eachother new technologies as well as developing our ability to work as teams.
                We also ran a number of small events where we invited non-society members to try out simpler tasks in order to show people how important digital literacy
                is and how it can aid them in their fields that may not be directly related to technology.
