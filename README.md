This is the very beginning of my personal portfolio website which I have admittedly had for a considerable length of time, but have only really now started to try and complete some work on it. I have recently changed 
completely how it looks and restyled the whole site. I intend to add much more information to it over the next few months as well as look into running the website online for other people to see. This will of course
be once I feel that the site is an acceptable state to do so.
